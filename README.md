Buildin for the [zprize](https://www.zprize.io/prizes/fastest-masp-circuit-groth16-prover-wasm) 

###  Anoma's multi-asset shielded pool circuit and mint-and-burn (convert) circuit, using the BLS12-381 curve. Note that this implementation is just an example, and may not be optimal for your use case.

- using "bellman" and "rand" for Groth16 system and circuit and "bls12_381" crate for the BLS12-381 curve
